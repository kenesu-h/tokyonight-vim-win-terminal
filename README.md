# tokyonight-vim-win-terminal
A port of ghifarit53's [tokyonight-vim](https://github.com/ghifarit53/tokyonight-vim) for Windows Terminal.

Ported because tokyonight-vim is ever so slightly different than enkia's
tokyonight colorscheme, and hasn't been ported by anyone yet.

# Installation
Choose your colorscheme variant:
- night.json
- storm.json

Then copy and paste the contents of the your variant's file into your Windows
Terminal configuration (settings.json).
